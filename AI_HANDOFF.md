## 1. What Kiwi is (in one paragraph)

Kiwi is a **Moroccan merchant operating system**, POS-first, and it is now a **real,
working product** — no longer a pitch/demo artifact. The **frontend** is vanilla
HTML/CSS/JS (no build step, no framework) served as a static site, but a **real backend is
LIVE**: **Cloudflare Pages Functions + D1** (`functions/`, `schema.sql`) power real
accounts/auth, the passcode + operator gates, Live Link sales, the operator console, and
caisse↔dashboard pairing — plus a real native **Kiwi Printer Bridge** (`bridge/`) for ESC/POS
thermal printing. Client state still lives in `localStorage`; server-authoritative data lives
in D1. It's **trilingual: FR / EN / AR with real RTL**. The flagship surface is
`dashboard.html`; **"Café Atlas" is only the DEMO tenant** (shown to a session with no real
account — never leak it to a real merchant). The public site is `index.html`. It must still
**demo flawlessly to investors and pilot cafés** — and now also **work for real merchants**.

## 2. Business model (Phase 1 — POS SaaS, four tiers)

- **Kiwi Basic · 199 MAD/mo** — software only, on the merchant's own hardware, unlimited
  devices, **1 établissement**, integrates into the existing till, on-site training + guides.
- **Kiwi Pro · 399 MAD/mo** — everything in Basic **+ 1 free Kiwi cashier**, T+1 settlement,
  hardware maintenance. (The demo account is "on Pro".)
- **Kiwi Ultra · 1 499 MAD/mo** — unlimited établissements, multi-pays, enterprise API,
  dedicated 24/7 account manager.
- **Kiwi Ultimate · sur devis** — bespoke; scope/device-count/price agreed with the client.

Phase 2 = Kiwi Pay (payment institution), Phase 3 = Banking/Investing. **Do NOT add
Pay/Banking/Investing surfaces unless explicitly asked.** **No public financials / asks /
projections** in any external-facing material — public macro data only. The pricing lives in:
the **upgrade modal** (`interactive.js` → `upgrade-pro`), the **landing** (`index.html`:
hero KPI, the editorial pricing manifesto, JSON-LD offers, FAQ, meta, priceRange), the
**savings calculator** (`ux.js` + `i18n.js`), the **sidebar upsell** (`venues.js`), and the
**account hub** (`account.js`). All four surfaces are in sync.

## 3. Stack & conventions (the stuff that bites you)

- **Vanilla frontend (by choice, not because it's a mock).** No React/Next/bundler for the
  UI — keep it that way unless a real need forces otherwise (raise it first). IIFE modules
  registering into `window.Kiwi.handlers`. Real server/native code lives in `functions/`
  (Cloudflare Pages Functions + D1) and `bridge/` (the printer bridge) — see CLAUDE.md §2.
- **Global click delegation** (`interactive.js`): `[data-action="x"]` `[data-arg="y"]` →
  `handlers['x'](element, 'y')`.
- **i18n**: `data-i18n="key"` on DOM (FR captured from DOM, EN/AR in a `T` dict in
  `i18n.js`); in JS use the per-module `tr({fr,en,ar})` / `pick({fr,en,ar})` helpers.
  Switch via `KiwiI18n.{setLang,getLang,setTheme,getTheme}`. RTL is driven by `html[lang="ar"]`.
- **Overlays** (`interactive.js`): `Kiwi.modal({title,tag,desc,body,foot,width}) → {el, close}`;
  `Kiwi.drawer(...)`; `Kiwi.appPage(id,{title,subtitle,body})` for **full-page destinations**
  (every sidebar/profile destination now uses this — no more side drawers, see commit
  `fc08d02`); `Kiwi.toast(title,{type,desc,force})`. **`modal()` escapes `title` and `tag`
  (XSS-hardened) but renders `desc`/`body`/`foot` as raw HTML** — never interpolate raw
  user/data into `body`; use the module's `esc()`.
- **Dark mode** (`theme.css`, applied via `html[data-theme="dark"]`): tokens **invert** —
  `--surface` (white→#151B18), `--paper`, **`--ink`/`--paper` SWAP roles**, `--warn-soft`/
  `--warn-ink`, `--n-*`, `--atlas`, `--mint`, `--danger`/`--info`. **Hardcoded hex does NOT
  invert.** **Never use `var(--ink)` as a background** (it goes light in dark — this exact
  mistake broke the sidebar and a dozen banners). `dark-fixes.js` is a runtime safety net
  that darkens stray near-white surfaces and relights dark-on-dark text — it's a band-aid,
  prefer fixing colors at the source with tokens.
- **Scroll-lock**: a global counter `window.__kiwiScrollLocks` + `html.kiwi-locked`. To
  dismiss a modal use the helper close path (e.g. `closeTopModal()` in stock.js), **not**
  `el.remove()` — raw removal leaks the counter and freezes page scroll.
- `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` are fine in normal browser JS (only forbidden inside
  `Workflow` scripts).

## 4. Passcodes (the lock screen on every load)

> **Hosted vs local:** on the LIVE site a real **server-side account gate** now sits in
> FRONT of everything (`functions/_middleware.js`: email/password accounts, the staff
> passcode bypass, and the operator console) — see `AUTH.md`/`ADMIN.md`. The client-side
> 4-digit PIN below is the *demo/local* layer; on the hosted site a real merchant reaches
> their OWN store, and **"any 4-digit → Café Atlas" must never leak to a real account.**

`dashboard.html` shows a 4-digit PIN gate every session (`paintCells()` ~line 5622). Codes:
`0000`→onboard, `0505`→marketing tease, `0909`→manager role (restricted sidebar), `1111`→
**unlocks the Croissance growth suite** (session only; `body.growth-locked` removed), any
other 4-digit → Café Atlas owner demo. "Entrer dans la démo" = skip. **Every passcode now
also enables the Design 2026 skin** (see below).
To drive the demo in the preview: enter a PIN (e.g. `1111`) into the lock input, or remove
`.kiwi-lock`/`.kiwi-greet` and `.kw-app-hidden` and call `Kiwi.handlers['account-profile']()`.

## 5. Design 2026 — "Liquid Glass" skin (reversible, gated)

- `assets/design-2026.css` — a modern Apple-era glass skin (ambient gradient-mesh + grain,
  frosted translucent surfaces with specular edge-light, rounding, green-tinted depth, spring
  motion) **executed in the Kiwi palette, no new accent colors**. **Every rule is scoped to
  `body.design-2026`** → inert when the class is absent; the classic design is untouched.
- `assets/design-2026.js` — exposes `window.KiwiDesign2026.{enable,disable,toggle,isUnlocked}`.
  Any passcode calls `enable()`; state persists in `localStorage.kiwiDesign2026`. **There is
  NO on-screen toggle** (the user had me remove the floating pill). To revert:
  `KiwiDesign2026.disable()` or delete the `<link>`/`<script>` in `dashboard.html`.
- **Gotchas learned the hard way:** the sidebar must use **fixed dark hex** (not `var(--ink)`,
  which inverts in dark and turned the sidebar white). **Do not force `.kiwi-lock` to
  `position:relative`** — it's a fixed full-screen overlay; doing so collapsed it and left the
  page half-blank (fixed in `08db17c`).
- **The light-mode intensity push landed (`94e8b64`):** richer 4-blob ambient mesh, deeper
  card glass, specular sheen on the home hero, frosted date-range pill + AI input, glass
  feed-row hovers, brand-tinted thin scrollbars, frosted PIN cells on the lock screen
  (visual props only — positioning untouched). (The demo bar was later removed by the
  partner in `e05e298`; the old `.demo-bar` glass rule is inert.)
- **iOS-27 TIER (`eaa421a`) — EXPERIMENTAL, gated behind PIN 1111 ONLY.** Translates
  Apple's real WWDC-2026 announcements (Jun 8: transparency slider, full-edge refractive
  sidebars with colored icons, glass layered into icons — source: macrumors.com/2026/06/08/
  apple-announces-liquid-glass-improvements/) into the Kiwi palette:
  `assets/design-ios27.css` + `assets/design-ios27.js`, every rule scoped
  `body.design-2026.design-ios27` (layers ON the stable skin, never replaces it).
  Smoked-glass full-edge sidebar (mesh refracts beneath; stays dark in both themes so no
  text re-theming), mint-colored nav icons + tinted count pills, layered-glass KPI icon
  chips, display-P3 mint, and the headline: a **Liquid Glass transparency control in
  Paramètres** (Clair/Standard/Givré/Opaque, persisted `kiwiGlassLevel`, FR/EN/AR) — clear
  mode clamps modals/drawers to a legibility floor (the iOS-26 lesson). Only the 1111 PIN
  calls `KiwiDesignIOS27.enable()`; revert = `KiwiDesignIOS27.disable()` (verified clean
  round-trip) or remove the design-ios27 `<link>`/`<script>`.

## 6. The account hub — `account.js` (`Mon profil`)

The owner's command center, fully editable, trilingual, light+dark correct:
- **Personal info** (name/email/phone/language) — persisted under `kiwiSet:owner*`.
- **Mes établissements** — one rich card per business (`BIZ_DEFAULTS`: Café Atlas, Maison
  Mansour, Spa Bahia) with live data (CA/commandes/équipe) + full **Moroccan legal identity**
  (ICE, IF, RC, Patente, CNSS, phone). 11-field editor per business; **"+ Ajouter"** creates
  new ones. Persistence: `kiwiSet:biz:<id>:<field>` for defaults, `kiwiBizExtra` (JSON) for
  added ones.
- **Abonnement** — wired to the 4-tier ladder: Upgrade (opens `upgrade-pro`), Downgrade
  (confirm → steps down `PLAN_LADDER`, persists `kiwiSet:plan`), Voir la facturation, and
  **Résilier** (routed to the account manager via WhatsApp/email/phone — **no destructive
  self-serve cancellation**, per policy).
- Also: `openBilling()` and `openHelp()` are real pages (commit `83045b7`).

## 7. Git workflow + deploy (READ THIS)

- **Everyone works on `main` now.** The old `dashboard-motion` vs `cafe-atlas` two-track
  split is history (long since merged). A partner and/or a second agent often push to `main`
  **in parallel, in this same working copy**, sometimes leaving **uncommitted WIP** in the
  tree. So: stage **specific paths, never `git add -A`**, and **read `git diff --cached`
  before committing** so you never sweep up their in-progress edits. If a file you edited also
  carries their unstaged changes, isolate your hunk (`git restore --staged <f>` then
  `git apply --cached` a patch of only your hunk).
- **Two GitHub remotes — every `main` commit must land on BOTH. Their remote NAMES reshuffle
  each session, so match by URL, not name:**
  - `github.com/zaka33333-hash/Kiwi` → **Cloudflare Pages `kiwi-maroc`** →
    kiwi-maroc.pages.dev / app.kiwi.ma. **Auto-deploys on push** — this is where the live
    product AND the demo run. (This is the one that must never go stale.)
  - `github.com/badro99/Kiwi` → **GitHub Pages + the business partner's copy.**
  Push `main` to both by URL. If a push is rejected: `git fetch`, inspect `HEAD..<remote>/main`,
  integrate (**never force**), re-run `tools/check.js`, push both.
- **No `/Users/badrosonair/Documents/kiwi` mirror exists on this machine** — ignore any
  instruction (incl. older CLAUDE.md prose) to push there.
- **Commit rule:** commit + push after every edit, no asking. Message `<scope> · <what
  changed>` + `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Never commit secrets.

## 8. What this session shipped (newest first)

**Jul 23:** **Boutique inventory + real barcode system (caisse 0002 ↔ dashboard, one
shared DB).** Two new engine modules, loaded in `kiwi-caisse.html`, `dashboard.html`,
`dashboard2.html`:
- `assets/barcode.js` (`window.KiwiBarcode`) — dependency-free, **real scannable** EAN-13
  (L/G/R + parity + mod-10 check) and Code 128-B encoders → inline SVG; `nextInStoreEan()`
  generates codes in the GS1 in-store range (prefix 20–29, never collides with real GTINs);
  `detect()`, `isValidEan13()`, and `printLabels(labels,{copies})` (a `@media print` label
  sheet → `window.print()` to the label printer).
- `assets/boutique-catalog.js` (`window.KiwiBoutiqueCatalog`) — the **shared product
  database** in `localStorage` (`kiwiBoutiqueCatalog:v1:maisonMansour`). Model: Category →
  Product → **Variant (= product × colour × size)**, each variant holds a `barcodes[]` list
  (a generated EAN-13 `primary` + any scanned old-POS codes kept verbatim as `imported`).
  Full CRUD + `generateBarcode`/`attachBarcode`/`findByBarcode`/`resolveScan`; `subscribe()`
  + `storage` event so the caisse tab and dashboard tab stay live-synced; seeds once from the
  caisse's old `RAYONS` (each product fanned into colour×size variants; legacy EANs kept as
  aliases). `compat()` rebuilds the old `{RAYONS,P,BY_EAN}` shape the caisse renders from.
- **Caisse (`pos-boutique.js`, PIN 0002)** — now catalog-backed (sale grid, sheet, scanner
  all track the live DB). New **Inventaire** nav view: create product · colour×size variants ·
  input stock · **generate + print EAN-13 labels** · **register an existing old-POS barcode**
  (no reprint). A **global keyboard-wedge scanner** (document keydown buffer) adds the exact
  scanned variant to the ticket from anywhere on the sales screen; unknown scan → "register
  on an article" flow. Stock decrements on a sale stay in-memory (demo); creation + stock
  input persist to the DB.
- **Dashboard (`pages-pro.js` `nav-inventory` + `nav-categories`)** — rewritten from static
  mock to live catalog: product grid → drawer with the variant matrix (editable stock,
  per-variant barcode chip, generate/print/register), real category **create/rename/recolour/
  delete** (with product reassignment). Handlers are prefixed `bqx-`.
- GOTCHA: `barcode.js` must load **before** `boutique-catalog.js`; both must load before
  `pos-dispatch.js` / `pages-pro.js`. `localStorage` sync is **same-origin only** (real
  cross-device sync waits for the backend). `window.print()` opens a native dialog — it can
  block headless browser tooling; that's the print path working, not a bug.

**Jun 25 (later):** `171b03f` **Ultra cross-site spend control** — `assets/depenses.js`
`render()` now branches custom → **fusion** → single. When the portfolio (fusion) venue is
active it paints the consolidated Ultra view: « EXCLUSIF ULTRA » banner (1 499 MAD/mois),
consolidated ledger (in/out/net across 3 sites), « Sorties par établissement » cards (click
→ `dep-site` → `KiwiVenue.setVenue(id)` drills into that single site), and ONE cross-site
approval inbox (`xpending`, site-tagged). `dep-approve`/`dep-refuse` are cross-site aware:
**x-prefixed ids** hit the portfolio inbox, numeric ids the single-venue one. A
`KiwiVenue.subscribe` re-renders the open page on venue change (so « Go Ultra » → portfolio,
site drill-in → single, both repaint in place). `b1f7ea7` surfaced Dépenses on the home via
a « Pour vous » oppo card (`open-depenses`). Verified live incl. AR.

**Jun 25:** `cb7a51b` **Kiwi Dépenses (Kiwi Pay · Phase 2)** — the outflow half of the
merchant OS. New full-page destination « Dépenses & cartes » (sidebar → new **KIWI PAY**
section, `data-nav="depenses"`, PHASE 2 tag). Self-contained `assets/depenses.js` (injects
own CSS, renders via `Kiwi.appPage`): two-sided ledger (encaissé vs dépensé vs net +
budget bar), 4 team **Kiwi cards** with per-category limits + freeze/unfreeze, **approve/
refuse** spend requests, budgets-by-category growing bars, recent-spend feed, supplier
bills (Payer). « Émettre une carte » modal issues a live virtual card. **Honest framing:**
a `KIWI PAY · PHASE 2` banner states cards + supplier payments need a Bank Al-Maghrib
payment-institution licence — roadmap preview, no real money. Custom (0000) venues get a
starter (no demo leak); manager role (0909) hides it like Marges/Paie. Wired: `nav-depenses`
handler, `FULL_PAGE_NAVS` (pages.js), i18n `dash.sidebar.{kiwipay,depenses}` EN+AR,
`role-manager` hide rule. Trilingual + dark-mode verified. To extend: edit the `cards` /
`pending` / `budgets` / `suppliers` seed + the `T`/`CAT` dicts in depenses.js. This was the
first **Pay/Banking surface** built — previously forbidden without explicit ask; the user
explicitly asked. Don't add more Pay/Banking surfaces beyond this without the same.

**Jun 11 (later):** `47c2002` **the whole home enters alive** — the c98e317 card entrance
played at DOM load, hidden BEHIND the PIN lock; users saw a frozen page. Now all three
reveal paths (PIN unlock 3 200 ms dive-in, 0000 onboard unlock, « Entrer dans la démo »
skipToApp) add `body.cards-enter`, and every entrance animation (blocks, .settle, oppo
cards, mix legend) is gated on it. Hover on every card upgraded to −2px lift + atlas border
tint. Heures-de-pointe bars rise (hh-rise, `--i` stagger) and feed rows cascade on real
data changes only — both gated `classList.toggle(x, !liveTickInProgress)` so the 3 s demo
tick never replays them. GOTCHA: any new load-time animation on the dashboard is invisible
(lock screen covers it) — gate it on `body.cards-enter`. oppo-cards base opacity:0 removed
(entrance moved into keyframes + backwards fill) so cards can't be stuck invisible.

**Jun 11 (late):** `f0efdfd`+`01b5149`+`6afd310` **kiwi-caisse becomes 14 POS verticals, one
per métier** — the dashboard's venue universe (boutique, spa, hôtel, fast-food, boulangerie,
pizzeria, traiteur, food truck, épicerie, pharmacie, librairie, fleuriste, coiffure, salle
de sport) now each has a real hardware POS app behind its own PIN. **`assets/pos-dispatch.js`**
is the router: registry `0002`–`0015` → lazy-loads `assets/pos-<id>.{js,css}` on first
unlock, owns the shared unlock/greet/lock choreography (dot success → fade → greeting flash →
`body.is-pos.is-pos-<id>`, lock-back via `__kiwiPinReset`), a tappable **code legend** on the
pin-foot, and an honest "module indisponible" toast if a module is missing. Modules
self-register: `KiwiPosDispatch.register({id, greet, mount(root), onShow})` — `mount` builds
into the dispatcher-provided root (`<div class="vx-screen" id="pos-<id>">`, fixed inset-0,
z-90), never `document.body`. **PIN map:** 0000 pressing · 0001 cuisine(KDS) · 0002 boutique
(Maison Mansour — échanges & avoirs, stock par taille) · 0003 spa (Spa Bahia — cures à carte
poinçonnée) · 0004 hôtel (Riad Yasmina — folio + taxe de séjour) · 0005 fast-food (Snack
Chamal — combo upsell, file d'appel) · 0006 boulangerie (Bab Kasbah — fournées/restant,
précommandes gâteaux) · 0007 pizzeria (La Marsa — moitié-moitié, livraison) · 0008 traiteur
(Dar Zellij — devis/personne, échéancier d'acomptes) · 0009 food truck (Karavan — vente 2
taps) · 0010 épicerie (Si Brahim — **le carnet de crédit/ardoise**, vente au poids) · 0011
pharmacie (Ibn Batouta — **tiers payant** part mutuelle/patient, opérationnel only) · 0012
librairie (Al Boughaz — commandes spéciales, listes scolaires) · 0013 fleuriste (Fleurs du
Détroit — composer de bouquet, carte message) · 0014 coiffure (Salon Yasmine — formule
couleur mémorisée) · 0015 gym (Atlas Fitness — check-in vert/rouge) · **tout autre code →
caisse restaurant Café Atlas, le démo principal, intact.** Each module (~1 100–1 700 lignes
JS) reuses the caisse tokens + modal kit (`.modal-veil/.cash-*/.reader-*/.ma-btn/.pay-tip`)
and `#toast-stack`, with its own `<prefix>-` CSS namespace, dark rail, SVG line-art, phone-
first clients, offline chip, seeded mid-shift Moroccan data. **Build method:** a build+review
agent **Workflow** (the first 14-agent run hit the 4:50pm session reset mid-flight — 8 built,
6 left; a second 12-agent run finished the rest). All 14 verified live by the orchestrator
(mount + every view renders + zero console errors + signature feature exercised). **Toast
z-index fix** rode along: `#toast-stack` shipped at z-90 = the vertical roots, so toasts
painted underneath — lifted to 200 under `body.is-pos`/`body.is-pressing` (restaurant
untouched). **Two gotchas for the next session:** (1) the preview tab kept getting hijacked
to `dashboard2.html` and the shared `:8765` server died repeatedly during the agent runs —
verify one PIN at a time, re-navigate + re-harness when it drifts, and don't trust the first
screenshot (intermittent DPR downscale — functional DOM probes are the reliable signal). (2)
**`assets/pressing.js` is stray untracked cruft** (the old `hx-`-prefixed pressing prototype,
superseded by `pressing-caisse.js`, referenced nowhere) — it's the sole `node tools/check.js`
failure (`data-action="modal-close"` unwired, + 3 `var(--ink)` warnings). Safe to delete;
left in place pending the owner's OK (not created by this session).

**Jun 11 (night):** `50bdbce`+`57b181b` **PIN 0000 turns kiwi-caisse into a pressing** —
the Tangier-prospect demo: one terminal, two métiers. His restaurant = any 4-digit code
(caisse untouched), his pressing = **0000**; the KDS station moved to **0001** (pin-foot
hint updated). New `assets/pressing-caisse.{js,css}` (~2 700 lines) inject a full laundry
counter scoped to `body.is-pressing` — the only shared surface is the 3-way PIN branch +
`window.__kiwiPinReset()` (extracted from lockoutKitchen). The **headline differentiator
is the VISUAL intake grid** (24 hand-drawn SVG garments, 6 catégories, prix MAD par
garment×service — text-list incumbents don't have this). Intake flow: tap garment →
config sheet (services **MULTI-SELECT et cumulables** — lavage + repassage = le classique,
prix additionnés, exclusions réelles sec⟷lavage/repassage via SVC_CONFLICTS, codes
combinés LAV+REP sur ticket/étiquettes/détail; les variantes restent single-select à la
**lentille liquide** — liquid-lens.js loads in the caisse, its selectors match nothing
restaurant-side; costume 2/3 pièces, tapis S/M/L, couleur, notes usuelles, **photo état**
mock) → ticket courant → client **PHONE-FIRST**
(reco fidèle + préférences, B2B –15 %, fiche rapide, passage) → date promise suggérée
(dimanche sauté) → **reçu thermique + 1 étiquette code-barres PAR PIÈCE** (costume 3p =
3 étiquettes) → encaissement (maintenant / acompte / **au retrait = habituel** / sur
compte B2B; espèces avec rendu, carte = montant envoyé au lecteur partenaire, V1 sans
encaissement Kiwi). Ops: tableau 4 statuts **par pièce** avec recherche téléphone,
détail à steppers, tout-prêt auto-déclenche le **WhatsApp « c'est prêt »** (+ photo du
vêtement fini), retrait par téléphone/scan (cintre en GROS, solde verrouille la remise),
rangement rails A/B/C × 12, hors-ligne simulé (file + sync). Demo data: **Pressing
Marshan** (Tanger), 7 clients dont **Hôtel Bab El Bahr** (compte B2B · facture mensuelle),
12 commandes seedées, 1 en retard. Gotchas: the caisse `.modal-veil`s are z-100 over
`.px-screen` z-90 but DOM ORDER decides between veils (close detail before opening
tags/pay); the offline banner needed `[hidden]{display:none}` (its `display:flex` was
winning); preview verification needs a **resize jiggle 1366×900↔901 to force repaint**
(hidden-tab compositor serves stale frames) and `preview_resize` must be re-applied
after every reload. Dashboard deliberately untouched (owner: "caisse only for now") —
the venue-switcher half of the pressing brief is still open.

**Jun 10 evening (6):** `c98e317` **every card is alive** — staggered card entrance
(.dash-col .block nth-child delays), hover lift (+shadow; rule is `html body .block` to
outrank theme.css's `html .block` color-only transition — merge color transitions in or
theme switching judders), Top produits mini-bars + bench bars draw in from 0 via
`growBars()` (dateRange.js: double-rAF + 450ms timer fallback for hidden tabs), rows
cascade via `--i` stagger, bench rank counts up (animateNumber). Health ring / mix donut /
rev chart were already animated. The 3s live tick only re-renders hero/KPI/chart/feed, so
nothing replays on its own; reduced-motion disables all of it.

**Jun 10 evening (5):** `74e56e8` **the 0000 session stops leaking the demo** — from a
merchant-created venue, the switcher still offered the 3 demo venues + « Go Ultra »
(fusion = demo aggregation), and « Marges → » opened Café Atlas's product margins. Now:
`renderDropdown` lists only the merchant's own venues in the 0000 session
(`window.__kiwiOnboard`, set at PIN entry) with an « Ajouter un établissement » CTA
(action `onboard`); dropdown rows escape merchant-typed name/location; `view-margins`
(dashboard-extra.js) gets a trilingual starter drawer for custom venues. Demo sessions
unchanged. NOTE: other [data-action] drawers reachable from custom venues may still show
demo data — guard them with the same isCustom pattern as they surface.

**Jun 10 evening (4):** `86d695d` **« Pour vous » opportunity cards** — Shopify-style
suggestion band under the KPI strip, Kiwi-native (`assets/oppo-cards.js`, self-contained:
injects its own CSS). 5-card pool × 3 slots, each card = one real feature (payment-link,
loyalty, agent-mode, capital, zakat) + a brand-token SVG illustration + one text CTA wired
to the feature's existing handler + a dismiss ✕ persisted in `kiwiOppoDismissed`; band
self-removes when the pool is dry. Staggered entrance, hover lift + art parallax,
reduced-motion + RTL safe, trilingual w/ langchange re-render. To add a card: append to
POOL + ART in oppo-cards.js (no other wiring).

**Jun 10 evening (3):** `bd45e69` **custom venues stop leaking demo data** — a fresh venue
opening « Catégories » landed on Maison Mansour's caftans (200 demo products, 249 320 MAD).
No page module had isCustom guards. New starter-page layer (end of pages-pro.js): 19
destinations render an honest « Encore rien ici — et c'est normal » starter for custom
venues — trade-titled via subtype profile (pharmacie → Familles & ordonnances), venue-named
subtitle, three what-will-appear bullets, `.gp-starter` CSS. CRITICAL gotcha discovered:
team.js / stock.js / conformite.js / finance.js re-install their nav handlers at
`load + setTimeout(0)` to win override wars — any naive load-time wrap gets clobbered.
The starter wrap is idempotent (`__kiwiStarter` flag), re-asserted at load+150ms AND on
every venue switch. Pass-through branch clears `page-genpage` (direct handler invocations
bypass the sidebar router's cleanup and would mask body-class pages like Équipe).

**Jun 10 evening (2):** `9b757a8` **every sidebar destination is a full page** — the last 8
drawer-based destinations (boutique: inventory/catégories/promos/retours · spa: calendrier
RDV/services/praticiennes/fiches clients) converted to `Kiwi.appPage()` full views, same as
transactions/terminaux/réservations. Root cause of the "raw text" look the user screenshotted:
the spa family's CSS (~80 classes: `.s-*` `.pr-*` `.sc-*`) had NEVER been written — now in
pages-pro.css (+260 lines, tokens only): positioned week-calendar grid, KPI strips, heat row,
waitlist, iOS toggle, package cards, practitioner cards, client CRM. appPage() now returns a
drawer-compatible `close()` (goes home) and rebuilds a fresh `.dash-genpage` host per render
(destinations attach listeners to the host — reuse stacked duplicates). Nested detail
drawers/wizards stay drawers on top of pages. Gotcha for future conversions: root lookups
must point at `.dash-genpage`, not `.kiwi-drawer`; drop `data-dismiss` foot buttons.

**Jun 10 evening:** `2368b21` **all 15 trades get full home-card vocabulary** — the vocab
layer extended from gym-only to every onboarding activity type. Each trade now has its own
feed badge ("FOUR ALLUMÉ", "EN TOURNÉE", "FOURNIL OUVERT"…), products card (Top boissons /
combos / fournées / pizzas / menus / titres / compositions…), manage link, staff card
(Performance vendeurs / praticiens / coiffeurs / coachs), evening card (précommandes gâteaux,
prochain événement, prochain emplacement, GARDE pharmacie, livraisons fleuriste), nav label
and ask-bar placeholder — all FR/EN/AR in `SUBTYPE_PROFILES[*].vocab` + `BASE_VOCAB`
(venues.js). Field-level merge: a subtype overrides only what differs from its base
vertical. All 15 probed live; AR pass on boulangerie; Café Atlas restores stock copy.

**Jun 10 early evening:** `9d805fa` **home cards speak the trade's language** — follow-up
to the subtype profiles: the user opened their gym and the home cards still said
« Première commande à venir », « ingrédients », « Gérer menu », « votre restaurant ».
New vocab layer: `BASE_VOCAB` (boutique/spa) + `SUBTYPE_PROFILES[*].vocab`
(sport/coiffure/pharmacie) in venues.js, resolved by `KiwiVenue.getVocab(section)`;
dateRange.js `tradeStr()` merges it over the default empty-state dicts (feed badge,
stock card, evening card, Top produits, Performance équipe, ask-bar placeholder, sidebar
« Commandes » → Passages/Ventes/Encaissements). Products/staff card titles + the manage
link moved from `data-i18n` to JS-owned text so the per-venue relabel can win — restores
mirror the former i18n values exactly. Also fixed the « NaN % » Rétention tile (0-division
in the retention derive on a fresh venue's zeroed data).

**Jun 10 end of afternoon:** `e5adccb` **each trade gets its own features** — the 15
onboarding activity types stop inheriting restaurant/boutique/spa wholesale.
`SUBTYPE_PROFILES` in venues.js: 12 full trilingual profiles (café, fast-food,
boulangerie, pizzeria, traiteur, food truck, épicerie, pharmacie, librairie, fleuriste,
coiffure, salle de sport), each with its own sidebar nav labels (mapped onto the base
vertical's nav targets, so pages still work), its own KPI band spec (keys from the valid
data-key set; labels in the trade's vocabulary — "Patients réguliers", "Retours labo",
"Passages", "Rétention"), and 3 **optional** step-2 onboarding questions. The wizard is
now two steps: type+name → trade questions with « Passer pour l'instant » skip; answers
persist as `profileInfo` on the custom venue (skip ⇒ null). KPI band wiring: profile
labels win over the generic KPI_CATALOG and tiles skip `data-i18n` (i18n.js would
overwrite them); the band re-renders on `kiwi:langchange` so AR/EN re-pick. Gotcha fixed
on the way: `vData()` zero-cloned **cafeAtlas** for every custom venue, so
vertical-specific tiles (tauxRetour, retention…) silently dropped — it now clones the
base type's demo sibling (maisonMansour / spaBahia). Verified live both paths:
Pharmacie (full answers, FR+AR) and Salle de sport (skip path).

**Jun 10 late afternoon:** `32b6b59` **Exclusif Ultra band** — the fusion/portfolio view
(the Ultra experience) gains Section 5b living the 1 499 pillars: actionable cross-site
AI rec (+3 800 MAD/sem staff transfer, real roster names), account manager card (Yasmine
Kabbaj, median 11 min), enterprise API panel (key/webhooks/SFTP/SLA), ROI header line
(≈0,1 % du CA portefeuille — matches the 1,47 M sidebar figure). Trilingual FS_ULTRA_STR
in venues.js; CTAs = honest toasts; upgrade modal Ultra tier now lists portfolio view +
ROI. NOTE: dashboard2.html (partner's hotel fork) has its own copies — not synced. ·
`6eeb0ac` **main column + side rail** (.dash-cols two independent stacks; cards pack at
exactly 14px; <1100px dissolves via display:contents + priority order).

**Jun 10 afternoon:** `993e60c` **the 10/10 polish sweep** — a 6-agent Workflow audit (71
graded findings, full output preserved in the commit message) → ~50 fixes in 23 files:
every flat-slab row hover → eased brand tint w/ rounded end cells; press states across the
overlay kit/landing/wallet; dark-mode root causes (venue dropdown, heatmap ramp via
color-mix, KDS invalid nested @keyframes strobe, .on-state specificity traps in growth
modules, sparkline token, ~40 leftover #fff); the ux.css duplicate focus rule that
RESHAPED buttons on keyboard focus; the dead Export button (cross-IIFE ReferenceError);
RTL mirrors for the 2026 row leans; brand.html 'Deux paliers' → 'Quatre formules. Deux
expressions.' Earlier same day: `cfbf1e6` lens-wash row hover (the user's canonical hated
slab), `9761527` conscious cards (.row align-items:start — cards end at their data) + the
analyses disclosure as a glass capsule w/ live count chip + animated unfold, `9309a98`
darker iOS-27 sidebar on desktop light, `b4a7a0c` night-crash fix (chart RangeError after
23h sim), `224919c` **la lentille liquide** brand motion + module. Deferred wave-2 (see
spawn-task chip / audit output): traveling lens for command palette + accounting tabs,
six-toggle standardization, .kit-empty empty-state rollout, premium.css deletion, .kb
radius unification.

**Past-midnight Jun 9→10:** `224919c` **LA LENTILLE LIQUIDE** — the capsule bar's sliding
highlight is now THE brand selection motion (`assets/liquid-lens.js`: spring
cubic-bezier(0.34,1.45,0.5,1)·310ms, 115ms stretch-then-settle). Auto-attached to the
dashboard date-range pills, resv/KDS tab rows, the landing audience switch, plus a live
demo + spec in brand.html 07·MOTION; CLAUDE.md §3 makes it a rule (new segmented controls
register in the lens module — never invent another active style). The module only watches
class/aria-selected mutations — existing handlers untouched. · `b4a7a0c` **night-crash
fix**: renderRevChart's live padding went negative after ~23h sim time (RangeError killed
the render+setLang chain for night viewers) — clip to 16 before padding.

**Late-night Jun 9:** `2f6bfad` **mobile capsule bar** — the dashboard's phone bottom nav
is now the serveur app's floating Liquid Glass capsule (same glass recipe + rubber-band
sliding lens, ported to `mobile-nav.js` `movePill()` / `mobile.css`), icon-first with
sr-only i18n labels, live Commandes badge mirroring the sidebar count; phone polish:
LIVE-chip nowrap, date-pill edge fades, 2 dark-mode `#fff` fixes, RTL bidi-isolate on
hero-breakdown values. Verified 375×812 light/dark × FR/AR.

**Push-to-10 polish session (evening Jun 9):** `0aa162e`+`59a8b68` **P0 hotfix — partner's

added subtrees (it was watching `.app` children while appPage mounts into `.container` —
near-dead before).

## 9. Honest quality state & what's left

**As a demo: ~9.5/10. As a production foundation: improving.** The backend has since landed
(Cloudflare D1 + Pages Functions: real accounts/auth, Live Link sales, operator console,
caisse↔dashboard pairing; plus the Kiwi Printer Bridge for real thermal printing). The old
"no backend — deliberate, that's the ceiling" framing is **obsolete** — production-readiness
is now an active work item, not an accepted 3.5. The vanilla **frontend** stays by choice.
Open items:
- **EN home-page accent scan returns zero leaks.** Standalone partner pages (kiwi-order,
  kiwi-caisse, kiwi-serveur) have their own inline dicts — out of i18n.js scope by design.
- **`background:var(--ink)` debt:** ~55 instances inventoried by tools/check.js as a
  warning (runtime-patched today by theme.css overrides + dark-fixes). Don't add more.
- **Savings calculator (`ux.js`):** stays honest, reframed off the "vs CMI" premise —
  **the user actively dislikes overpromising**.
- **Perf:** ~3.5 MB `.mov` in `menu_try_video/` (lazy, metadata-only preload) — fine.
  dark-fixes now rescans only added subtrees, never the full app.
- **Paramètres-as-page:** still offered, still not done (drawer is now fully trilingual).

## 10. How to verify (the loop that works)

**Run `node tools/check.js` before every push** — syntax, data-action↔handler coverage,
i18n EN/AR parity, balanced `<script>` tags, forbidden patterns. Exit 0 or don't ship.
Use the **preview tools** (`preview_start` → `kiwi-static` on **:4173**, then
`localhost:4173/dashboard.html`). Enter a PIN to pass the lock (or click the skip button).
**Always verify across {light, dark} × {FR, EN, AR-RTL}.** **Screenshots are ground truth**
— the contrast scanners give false positives on gradients, trust the picture. Note: the
preview tab is hidden, so `requestAnimationFrame` doesn't fire between evals — take a
screenshot to pump frames before asserting on rAF-gated UI (toasts).
**The partner pushes to main while you work.** Twice in one evening: a feature commit and
a parallel hotfix. If `git push origin HEAD:main` is rejected: `git fetch origin`, inspect
`git log HEAD..origin/main`, merge (never force), re-run `tools/check.js`, push both. Their
Safari-fallback commit shipped with a missing `</script>` that silently killed i18n — the
balanced-tags check exists because of it; run it on THEIR commits after every merge.
`tools/push-both.sh` does the two-branch push with the right failure message.

## 11. User preferences (also in the memory system)

Commit & push everything without asking (both branches). The Kiwi AI agent must handle
multi-turn corrections — the user calls bad/forgetful answers "bullshitting." Wants a
bleeding-edge **2026 / iOS-era "Liquid Glass"** look, with big visual experiments **gated +
reversible**. Values **accuracy and honesty** over hype. Action-oriented — prefers "just do
it and push" over long check-ins.
