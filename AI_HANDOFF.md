## 1. What Kiwi is (in one paragraph)

Kiwi is a **Moroccan merchant operating system**, POS-first. This repo is a **pitch/demo
artifact** — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, **no build step, no framework, no backend** (all data is
mocked client-side and persisted in `localStorage`). It's **trilingual: FR / EN / AR with
real RTL**. The flagship surface is `dashboard.html` (the merchant dashboard for a demo
café group, "Café Atlas"). The public site is `index.html`. Treat it as something that has
to **look and demo flawlessly to investors and pilot cafés** — design and polish are part
of the sale.

## 2. Business model (Phase 1 — POS SaaS, four tiers)

- **Kiwi Basic · 199 MAD/mo** — software only, on the merchant's own hardware, unlimited
  devices, **1 établissement**, integrates into the existing till, on-site training + guides.
- **Kiwi Pro · 399 MAD/mo** — everything in Basic **+ 1 free Kiwi cashier**, T+1 settlement,
  hardware maintenance. (The demo account is "on Pro".)
- **Kiwi Ultra · 1 499 MAD/mo** — unlimited établissements, multi-pays, enterprise API,
  dedicated 24/7 account manager.
- **Kiwi Ultimate · sur devis** — bespoke; scope/device-count/price agreed with the client.

Phase 2 = Kiwi Pay (payment institution), Phase 3 = Banking/Investing. **Do NOT add
Pay/Banking/Investing surfaces unless explicitly asked.** **No public financials / asks /
projections** in any external-facing material — public macro data only. The pricing lives in:
the **upgrade modal** (`interactive.js` → `upgrade-pro`), the **landing** (`index.html`:
hero KPI, the editorial pricing manifesto, JSON-LD offers, FAQ, meta, priceRange), the
**savings calculator** (`ux.js` + `i18n.js`), the **sidebar upsell** (`venues.js`), and the
**account hub** (`account.js`). All four surfaces are in sync.

## 3. Stack & conventions (the stuff that bites you)

- **Vanilla, locked.** No React/Next/bundler. Don't migrate. IIFE modules registering into
  `window.Kiwi.handlers`.
- **Global click delegation** (`interactive.js`): `[data-action="x"]` `[data-arg="y"]` →
  `handlers['x'](element, 'y')`.
- **i18n**: `data-i18n="key"` on DOM (FR captured from DOM, EN/AR in a `T` dict in
  `i18n.js`); in JS use the per-module `tr({fr,en,ar})` / `pick({fr,en,ar})` helpers.
  Switch via `KiwiI18n.{setLang,getLang,setTheme,getTheme}`. RTL is driven by `html[lang="ar"]`.
- **Overlays** (`interactive.js`): `Kiwi.modal({title,tag,desc,body,foot,width}) → {el, close}`;
  `Kiwi.drawer(...)`; `Kiwi.appPage(id,{title,subtitle,body})` for **full-page destinations**
  (every sidebar/profile destination now uses this — no more side drawers, see commit
  `fc08d02`); `Kiwi.toast(title,{type,desc,force})`. **`modal()` escapes `title` and `tag`
  (XSS-hardened) but renders `desc`/`body`/`foot` as raw HTML** — never interpolate raw
  user/data into `body`; use the module's `esc()`.
- **Dark mode** (`theme.css`, applied via `html[data-theme="dark"]`): tokens **invert** —
  `--surface` (white→#151B18), `--paper`, **`--ink`/`--paper` SWAP roles**, `--warn-soft`/
  `--warn-ink`, `--n-*`, `--atlas`, `--mint`, `--danger`/`--info`. **Hardcoded hex does NOT
  invert.** **Never use `var(--ink)` as a background** (it goes light in dark — this exact
  mistake broke the sidebar and a dozen banners). `dark-fixes.js` is a runtime safety net
  that darkens stray near-white surfaces and relights dark-on-dark text — it's a band-aid,
  prefer fixing colors at the source with tokens.
- **Scroll-lock**: a global counter `window.__kiwiScrollLocks` + `html.kiwi-locked`. To
  dismiss a modal use the helper close path (e.g. `closeTopModal()` in stock.js), **not**
  `el.remove()` — raw removal leaks the counter and freezes page scroll.
- `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` are fine in normal browser JS (only forbidden inside
  `Workflow` scripts).

## 4. Passcodes (the lock screen on every load)

`dashboard.html` shows a 4-digit PIN gate every session (`paintCells()` ~line 5622). Codes:
`0000`→onboard, `0505`→marketing tease, `0909`→manager role (restricted sidebar), `1111`→
**unlocks the Croissance growth suite** (session only; `body.growth-locked` removed), any
other 4-digit → Café Atlas owner demo. "Entrer dans la démo" = skip. **Every passcode now
also enables the Design 2026 skin** (see below).
To drive the demo in the preview: enter a PIN (e.g. `1111`) into the lock input, or remove
`.kiwi-lock`/`.kiwi-greet` and `.kw-app-hidden` and call `Kiwi.handlers['account-profile']()`.

## 5. Design 2026 — "Liquid Glass" skin (reversible, gated)

- `assets/design-2026.css` — a modern Apple-era glass skin (ambient gradient-mesh + grain,
  frosted translucent surfaces with specular edge-light, rounding, green-tinted depth, spring
  motion) **executed in the Kiwi palette, no new accent colors**. **Every rule is scoped to
  `body.design-2026`** → inert when the class is absent; the classic design is untouched.
- `assets/design-2026.js` — exposes `window.KiwiDesign2026.{enable,disable,toggle,isUnlocked}`.
  Any passcode calls `enable()`; state persists in `localStorage.kiwiDesign2026`. **There is
  NO on-screen toggle** (the user had me remove the floating pill). To revert:
  `KiwiDesign2026.disable()` or delete the `<link>`/`<script>` in `dashboard.html`.
- **Gotchas learned the hard way:** the sidebar must use **fixed dark hex** (not `var(--ink)`,
  which inverts in dark and turned the sidebar white). **Do not force `.kiwi-lock` to
  `position:relative`** — it's a fixed full-screen overlay; doing so collapsed it and left the
  page half-blank (fixed in `08db17c`).
- **The light-mode intensity push landed (`94e8b64`):** richer 4-blob ambient mesh, deeper
  card glass, specular sheen on the home hero, frosted date-range pill + AI input, glass
  feed-row hovers, brand-tinted thin scrollbars, frosted PIN cells on the lock screen
  (visual props only — positioning untouched). (The demo bar was later removed by the
  partner in `e05e298`; the old `.demo-bar` glass rule is inert.)
- **iOS-27 TIER (`eaa421a`) — EXPERIMENTAL, gated behind PIN 1111 ONLY.** Translates
  Apple's real WWDC-2026 announcements (Jun 8: transparency slider, full-edge refractive
  sidebars with colored icons, glass layered into icons — source: macrumors.com/2026/06/08/
  apple-announces-liquid-glass-improvements/) into the Kiwi palette:
  `assets/design-ios27.css` + `assets/design-ios27.js`, every rule scoped
  `body.design-2026.design-ios27` (layers ON the stable skin, never replaces it).
  Smoked-glass full-edge sidebar (mesh refracts beneath; stays dark in both themes so no
  text re-theming), mint-colored nav icons + tinted count pills, layered-glass KPI icon
  chips, display-P3 mint, and the headline: a **Liquid Glass transparency control in
  Paramètres** (Clair/Standard/Givré/Opaque, persisted `kiwiGlassLevel`, FR/EN/AR) — clear
  mode clamps modals/drawers to a legibility floor (the iOS-26 lesson). Only the 1111 PIN
  calls `KiwiDesignIOS27.enable()`; revert = `KiwiDesignIOS27.disable()` (verified clean
  round-trip) or remove the design-ios27 `<link>`/`<script>`.

## 6. The account hub — `account.js` (`Mon profil`)

The owner's command center, fully editable, trilingual, light+dark correct:
- **Personal info** (name/email/phone/language) — persisted under `kiwiSet:owner*`.
- **Mes établissements** — one rich card per business (`BIZ_DEFAULTS`: Café Atlas, Maison
  Mansour, Spa Bahia) with live data (CA/commandes/équipe) + full **Moroccan legal identity**
  (ICE, IF, RC, Patente, CNSS, phone). 11-field editor per business; **"+ Ajouter"** creates
  new ones. Persistence: `kiwiSet:biz:<id>:<field>` for defaults, `kiwiBizExtra` (JSON) for
  added ones.
- **Abonnement** — wired to the 4-tier ladder: Upgrade (opens `upgrade-pro`), Downgrade
  (confirm → steps down `PLAN_LADDER`, persists `kiwiSet:plan`), Voir la facturation, and
  **Résilier** (routed to the account manager via WhatsApp/email/phone — **no destructive
  self-serve cancellation**, per policy).
- Also: `openBilling()` and `openHelp()` are real pages (commit `83045b7`).

## 7. The two dev tracks + git workflow (READ THIS)

- **Two collaborators.** "Us" work on branch **`dashboard-motion`** (agent/growth/dark-mode/
  design/account/pricing). The **partner (badro)** built the **"cafe-atlas" track** on
  `main` (split-bill, video tiles, and the modules `finance.js`, `stock.js`, `team.js`,
  `conformite.js`, `marketing-suite-tease.js`, plus `cafe-atlas.html`/`kiwi-caisse.html`/
  `kiwi-serveur.html`). The two tracks were **merged** this session (`f0a312c`) — both fully
  preserved. Safety backups exist locally: `backup/dashboard-motion-pre-merge`,
  `refs/backup/origin-main-pre-merge`.
- **Remotes:** `origin` = `github.com/badro99/Kiwi` (shared, the one that matters);
  `fork` = `github.com/zaka33333-hash/Kiwi`.
- **Commit rule (from CLAUDE.md):** commit + push after **every** edit, no asking. Stage
  **specific paths** (never `git add -A`). Message format `<scope> · <what changed>` + footer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`. **Land every commit
  on BOTH `origin/dashboard-motion` AND `origin/main`** (fast-forward main to the new commit;
  the in-session pattern is `git push origin <sha>:main`). The local mirror
  `/Users/badrosonair/Documents/kiwi` referenced in CLAUDE.md **does NOT exist on this
  machine — skip it.** Don't commit secrets.

## 8. What this session shipped (newest first)

**Jun 10 late afternoon:** `32b6b59` **Exclusif Ultra band** — the fusion/portfolio view
(the Ultra experience) gains Section 5b living the 1 499 pillars: actionable cross-site
AI rec (+3 800 MAD/sem staff transfer, real roster names), account manager card (Yasmine
Kabbaj, median 11 min), enterprise API panel (key/webhooks/SFTP/SLA), ROI header line
(≈0,1 % du CA portefeuille — matches the 1,47 M sidebar figure). Trilingual FS_ULTRA_STR
in venues.js; CTAs = honest toasts; upgrade modal Ultra tier now lists portfolio view +
ROI. NOTE: dashboard2.html (partner's hotel fork) has its own copies — not synced. ·
`6eeb0ac` **main column + side rail** (.dash-cols two independent stacks; cards pack at
exactly 14px; <1100px dissolves via display:contents + priority order).

**Jun 10 afternoon:** `993e60c` **the 10/10 polish sweep** — a 6-agent Workflow audit (71
graded findings, full output preserved in the commit message) → ~50 fixes in 23 files:
every flat-slab row hover → eased brand tint w/ rounded end cells; press states across the
overlay kit/landing/wallet; dark-mode root causes (venue dropdown, heatmap ramp via
color-mix, KDS invalid nested @keyframes strobe, .on-state specificity traps in growth
modules, sparkline token, ~40 leftover #fff); the ux.css duplicate focus rule that
RESHAPED buttons on keyboard focus; the dead Export button (cross-IIFE ReferenceError);
RTL mirrors for the 2026 row leans; brand.html 'Deux paliers' → 'Quatre formules. Deux
expressions.' Earlier same day: `cfbf1e6` lens-wash row hover (the user's canonical hated
slab), `9761527` conscious cards (.row align-items:start — cards end at their data) + the
analyses disclosure as a glass capsule w/ live count chip + animated unfold, `9309a98`
darker iOS-27 sidebar on desktop light, `b4a7a0c` night-crash fix (chart RangeError after
23h sim), `224919c` **la lentille liquide** brand motion + module. Deferred wave-2 (see
spawn-task chip / audit output): traveling lens for command palette + accounting tabs,
six-toggle standardization, .kit-empty empty-state rollout, premium.css deletion, .kb
radius unification.

**Past-midnight Jun 9→10:** `224919c` **LA LENTILLE LIQUIDE** — the capsule bar's sliding
highlight is now THE brand selection motion (`assets/liquid-lens.js`: spring
cubic-bezier(0.34,1.45,0.5,1)·310ms, 115ms stretch-then-settle). Auto-attached to the
dashboard date-range pills, resv/KDS tab rows, the landing audience switch, plus a live
demo + spec in brand.html 07·MOTION; CLAUDE.md §3 makes it a rule (new segmented controls
register in the lens module — never invent another active style). The module only watches
class/aria-selected mutations — existing handlers untouched. · `b4a7a0c` **night-crash
fix**: renderRevChart's live padding went negative after ~23h sim time (RangeError killed
the render+setLang chain for night viewers) — clip to 16 before padding.

**Late-night Jun 9:** `2f6bfad` **mobile capsule bar** — the dashboard's phone bottom nav
is now the serveur app's floating Liquid Glass capsule (same glass recipe + rubber-band
sliding lens, ported to `mobile-nav.js` `movePill()` / `mobile.css`), icon-first with
sr-only i18n labels, live Commandes badge mirroring the sidebar count; phone polish:
LIVE-chip nowrap, date-pill edge fades, 2 dark-mode `#fff` fixes, RTL bidi-isolate on
hero-breakdown values. Verified 375×812 light/dark × FR/AR.

**Push-to-10 polish session (evening Jun 9):** `0aa162e`+`59a8b68` **P0 hotfix — partner's
Safari-fallback commit ate the role-gate's `</script>`, which swallowed the i18n.js include
(blank/FR-only dashboard on main for ~30 min; both of us fixed it in parallel, merged
clean)** · `78dc7af` i18n: live-feed payment strings translated at render time, sidebar
upsell FR/EN/AR + langchange re-render, `sidebar.restaurant.finance` key, RTL bidi-isolate
on hero money figures · `56e3ef6` **tools/check.js smoke suite** (syntax, data-action↔handler
coverage, i18n EN/AR parity, balanced `<script>` tags, forbidden patterns) + tools/push-both.sh;
its first run found two dead spa-services buttons (svc-new, svc-cure-edit — wired) and the
missing role-badge key · `4f5467f` Settings drawer fully FR/EN/AR + **stored-XSS fix**
(custom-venue name/hours/methods were interpolated unescaped) · `94e8b64` Liquid Glass
light-mode push · `831fe88` pages-pro.css 36 white surfaces → `var(--surface)` ·
`4ac23da` **reservations page rebuilt honest**: real dates (Intl per lang), derived counts,
full FR/EN/AR incl. booking notes · `da144fa` a11y batch: menu keyboard nav (roles/arrows/
Escape/focus return), toast live region, appPage focus-to-h1, skip-to-content link, drawer
title escaping, 13 injected-CSS white surfaces → tokens, dark-fixes observer scoped to
added subtrees (it was watching `.app` children while appPage mounts into `.container` —
near-dead before).

**Earlier session:** `08db17c` remove Design-2026 pill (+fix the lock-screen collapse it exposed) · `a001f51`
enable Design 2026 on every passcode · `a13df9f` **Liquid Glass 2026 skin** · `d48135f`
**expand Mon profil → account+business hub** · `83045b7` real Profil/Facturation/Aide pages ·
`fc08d02` unify destinations to full-page format · `e58c4f6` a11y (icon-button aria-labels) ·
`1b3246e` reframe the CMI savings calc · `6ecffe7` **HACCP + equipment data fully trilingual** ·
`ea1fd7b` propagate 4-tier pricing everywhere · `9fb919f` **4-tier upgrade modal** · `1c618f5`
lazy videos · `b1a6341` more conformité/stock i18n · `50654d8` conformité dialog a11y ·
`8ddcc98` make Settings actually customizable. Earlier in the session: comprehensive dark-mode
pass, the big merge, PIN-gated Croissance, finance i18n, **P0 stored-XSS fix at the `modal()`
helper**, stock scroll-lock-leak fix.

## 9. Honest quality state & what's left

**As a demo: ~9.5/10. As a production foundation: ~7** after the push-to-10 session
(locked vanilla stack and monolith files remain by design until a backend lands — that's
the ceiling, not negligence). Scorecard (Jun 9 night): design 10, feature breadth 9.5,
honesty 10, docs 10, i18n 9.5, dark mode 9.5, a11y 9, security 8.5, git hygiene 9.5
(tools/push-both.sh), architecture 7 (first safety net exists now), perf 7.5, production
readiness 3.5 (no backend — deliberate). Open items, all small:
- **EN home-page accent scan returns zero leaks.** Standalone partner pages (cafe-atlas,
  kiwi-caisse, kiwi-serveur) have their own inline dicts — out of i18n.js scope by design.
- **`background:var(--ink)` debt:** ~55 instances inventoried by tools/check.js as a
  warning (runtime-patched today by theme.css overrides + dark-fixes). Don't add more.
- **Savings calculator (`ux.js`):** stays honest, reframed off the "vs CMI" premise —
  **the user actively dislikes overpromising**.
- **Perf:** ~3.5 MB `.mov` in `menu_try_video/` (lazy, metadata-only preload) — fine.
  dark-fixes now rescans only added subtrees, never the full app.
- **Paramètres-as-page:** still offered, still not done (drawer is now fully trilingual).

## 10. How to verify (the loop that works)

**Run `node tools/check.js` before every push** — syntax, data-action↔handler coverage,
i18n EN/AR parity, balanced `<script>` tags, forbidden patterns. Exit 0 or don't ship.
Use the **preview tools** (`preview_start` → `kiwi-static` on **:4173**, then
`localhost:4173/dashboard.html`). Enter a PIN to pass the lock (or click the skip button).
**Always verify across {light, dark} × {FR, EN, AR-RTL}.** **Screenshots are ground truth**
— the contrast scanners give false positives on gradients, trust the picture. Note: the
preview tab is hidden, so `requestAnimationFrame` doesn't fire between evals — take a
screenshot to pump frames before asserting on rAF-gated UI (toasts).
**The partner pushes to main while you work.** Twice in one evening: a feature commit and
a parallel hotfix. If `git push origin HEAD:main` is rejected: `git fetch origin`, inspect
`git log HEAD..origin/main`, merge (never force), re-run `tools/check.js`, push both. Their
Safari-fallback commit shipped with a missing `</script>` that silently killed i18n — the
balanced-tags check exists because of it; run it on THEIR commits after every merge.
`tools/push-both.sh` does the two-branch push with the right failure message.

## 11. User preferences (also in the memory system)

Commit & push everything without asking (both branches). The Kiwi AI agent must handle
multi-turn corrections — the user calls bad/forgetful answers "bullshitting." Wants a
bleeding-edge **2026 / iOS-era "Liquid Glass"** look, with big visual experiments **gated +
reversible**. Values **accuracy and honesty** over hype. Action-oriented — prefers "just do
it and push" over long check-ins.
