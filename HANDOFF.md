**Location:** `/Users/badrosonair/Documents/kiwi/` (mirror at `/tmp/kiwi-preview/`) · GitHub `https://github.com/badro99/Kiwi` (auto-pushed after every edit — see `CLAUDE.md` §1)
**Status:** High-fidelity interactive prototype. Not production code. Demo-ready for investor + client meetings.
**Founders:** Badr-Eddin Bakkioui (CEO) & Zakariae Attahiri (CTO · COO) · `invest@kiwi.ma` · Tanger

## 0. What Kiwi is

A Moroccan fintech super-app, POS-first. Phase 1 = **pure SaaS subscription for restaurants, cafés and retail**, four tiers: **Kiwi Basic 199 MAD/month** (software only, on the merchant's own hardware, integrated into the existing till, training + guides included), **Kiwi Pro 399 MAD/month** (everything in Basic + one free Kiwi cashier, T+1 settlement, hardware maintenance), **Kiwi Ultra 1 499 MAD/month** (unlimited établissements, multi-pays, API enterprise, dedicated 24/7 account manager) and **Kiwi Ultimate · sur devis** (bespoke). Hardware (PAX A920, KDS tablet, Kiwi Tap SoftPOS) is **loaned for free** from Pro upward. Zero commitment, WhatsApp-native support. Phase 2 = **Kiwi Pay** (own Payment Institution license, SoftPOS on server phones, low merchant margins) + Kiwi Banking. Phase 3 = Kiwi Investing (fractional AMMC, halal filter).

Brand positioning: *"Le système d'exploitation du commerçant marocain."* Aesthetic = Mercury / Ramp / Stripe tier, but with Moroccan-specific cultural intelligence (Darija-Arabizi in the voice, Zakat/Sadaqa as native features, Friday/Ramadan rhythms, diaspora France↔Morocco corridor as a defensible wedge).

**Revenue phases represented in the prototype:**
1. Phase 1 — Kiwi Basic SaaS · 199 MAD/month (software only on the merchant's own hardware, 1 établissement, integrated into existing till, training + guides)
2. Phase 1 — Kiwi Pro SaaS · 399 MAD/month (Basic + 1 free Kiwi cashier, règlement T+1, hardware maintenance)
   · Kiwi Ultra · 1 499 MAD/month (unlimited établissements, multi-pays, API, dedicated AM) · Kiwi Ultimate · sur devis (bespoke)
3. Phase 2 — Kiwi Pay (acquiring under own PE license, servers accept on their own Android, low MDR to merchants)
4. Phase 2 — Kiwi Banking · Kiwi Compte IBAN + debit card + Murabaha lending
5. Phase 3 — Kiwi Investing · fractional AMMC funds, halal filter, CSE + ETFs
6. Cross-cutting — remote Payment Links, Zakat calculator + Sadaqa round-up, diaspora FX corridor (France ↔ Maroc)

Hardware is a Kiwi CapEx line — **never a revenue line**. The distribution moat is that merchants switch from CMI without upfront cost.

## 1. Tech stack (deliberately boring)

- **Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS.** No React, no build step, no framework, no bundler.
- **Serves from a Python `http.server`** (sandboxed copy at `/tmp/kiwi-preview/`).
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts — Inter Tight, Instrument Serif, IBM Plex Sans Arabic, JetBrains Mono.
- **No backend.** All interactions are mocked client-side via toasts, modals, and drawers.
- **localStorage** for persistence (lang, theme, mode).

The choice of vanilla was intentional: the prototype must be demonstrable by anyone, anywhere, without toolchain. Any agent inheriting this project should resist the urge to "migrate to Next.js" — the vanilla decision is deliberate and durable until the first real backend lands.

## 3. How to run

```bash
# Option A — Python (what we use)
cd /Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi && python3 _serve.py
# then open http://localhost:4321/index.html

# Option B — any static server
python3 -m http.server 4321 --directory /Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi
# or: npx serve kiwi · or: caddy file-server

# Option C — just open the files directly
# open -a Safari /Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi/index.html
# (works for index/wallet/brand/pitch; dashboard needs a server for the i18n module path)
```

**The sandboxed preview copy at `/tmp/kiwi-preview/` is served on port 4321** by a launched Python server (see `.claude/launch.json` one directory up). Keep the two directories in sync: any edit in `kiwi/` must be copied to `/tmp/kiwi-preview/` before the browser preview reflects it.

```bash
# Sync pattern:
cp /Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi/<file> /tmp/kiwi-preview/
cp /Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi/assets/<file> /tmp/kiwi-preview/assets/
```

---

## 4. Brand system (locked, do not redesign)

**Colors** (defined in `assets/tokens.css`):
- Primary: `#0B6E4F` — Atlas Green
- Deep:    `#053B2C` — Riad
- Accent:  `#7DF2B0` — Mint (use ≤5% of surface area)
- Paper:   `#F7F5F0` — warm bone (never pure white for backgrounds)
- Ink:     `#0A0F0D` — warm near-black
- Full neutral ramp `--n-50` through `--n-800`
- Semantic: `--success #1FB574`, `--warning #D99A2B`, `--danger #C94A3A`, `--info #3A6FB8`

**Typography:**
- Display + body: **Inter Tight** (Medium 500 for headlines — never Bold)
- Editorial italic: **Instrument Serif** (use for 1 word per headline, not more)
- Arabic: **IBM Plex Sans Arabic**
- Monospace: **JetBrains Mono** (tabular numbers)

**Logo:** lowercase wordmark "kiwi" + mint-dot accent. No fruit imagery. Ever.

**Voice:** Direct, Moroccan, adult. Darija-Arabizi for emotional CTAs (*flousak kayji ghda sbah*), French for descriptive copy. Never formal French. No emoji in headlines. No orientalist clichés.

**Locked don'ts** (every agent inheriting must respect):
- No emoji in section titles or CTAs
- No stock photography (when real photos are added, shoot original Moroccan merchants)
- No gradient backgrounds behind hero copy (gradients only inside product-UI indicators)
- No Bold weights on display text
- No multiple accent colors in the same viewport
- No tagine / lantern / camel / souk iconography
- No pure white `#fff` — use `var(--paper)` which is `#F7F5F0`

---

## 5. Key architectural decisions

### 5.1 Language system (`assets/i18n.js`)

The **captured-originals pattern**: on page load, we walk every `[data-i18n]` element and store its FR content in memory under its key. When switching to EN or AR, we swap innerHTML from the `T[lang][key]` dictionary. Switching back to FR restores from captured originals — so FR translations don't need to exist in the dictionary (saves ~40% of the file).

RTL is triggered by `document.documentElement.dir = 'rtl'` on Arabic. Most layout flips naturally (flex, grid, logical properties). For directional arrows in buttons, `theme.css` has `html[dir="rtl"] .btn svg { transform: scaleX(-1); }`.

### 5.2 Mode system (Simple / Pro)

Toggled via `html[data-mode="simple"]` or `"pro"`. Persisted in `localStorage.kiwiMode`. Default = `simple` (per founder direction for accessibility).

In **Simple Mode**, `simple.css` hides `.container` (the Pro dashboard body), `.topbar`, `.sidebar`, `.status-bar`, `.demo-bar`, `.ai-drawer`, `.ramadan-banner`. The `.simple-root` injected by `simple.js` is a 520px-centered column with 3 tabs (Lyoum · Flousi · 3awn). 18px body, 36px amounts, 56px tap targets. Routes simple-action events to the rich Pro-mode handlers (`payment-link`, `new-sale`, `kiwi-compte`) so the same logic is reused.

In **Pro Mode**, simple UI elements are removed from the DOM and the regular dashboard is visible with its sidebar, topbar, live feed, AI drawer, etc.

A big pill toggle lives **fixed top-right** in both modes. Also switchable via `⌘⇧M` keyboard shortcut.

### 5.3 Interaction layer (`assets/interactive.js`)

**Event delegation, not per-element handlers.** One global click listener routes based on:
1. Explicit `[data-action="…"]` with registered handler
2. Range/tab toggles
3. Language switcher
4. Anchor smooth-scroll
5. AI drawer suggestions/close
6. Feed rows / KPI cards / sidebar links / location switcher / profile menu
7. Icon buttons (notifications, settings)
8. Fallback for plain `.btn` classes — **but scoped via `SKIP_FALLBACK_CONTAINERS` and `SKIP_FALLBACK_ATTRS`** so it never fires inside modals, drawers, menus, or on elements with their own handler.

All modals/drawers created via `Kiwi.modal({...})` / `Kiwi.drawer({...})` / `Kiwi.toast(...)`. Fully keyboard-closable via Escape. Click on backdrop closes. First focus does NOT auto-trap (known QA gap — see §7).

### 5.4 Feature handlers (`assets/features.js`)

Each feature is a handler registered on `Kiwi.handlers[name]` and opens a modal or drawer. Handlers are idempotent and self-contained. Registered names:
- `payment-link`, `zakat`, `sadaqa`, `ramadan-toggle`, `kiwi-compte`, `capital`, `diaspora`, `loyalty`, `agent-mode`

Calling `Kiwi.handlers['zakat']()` from anywhere opens the Zakat calculator.

### 5.5 Pages (`assets/pages.js`)

The 10 sidebar destinations on the dashboard. Each one is a full-width drawer with real-looking data tables, cards, or calendars. Handler names are prefixed with `nav-` (e.g., `nav-transactions`, `nav-kds`, `nav-stock`). Wired to sidebar links via `data-nav="transactions"` etc.

### 5.6 UX layer (`assets/ux.js`, shipped latest)

Currently on landing + dashboard:
- Scroll progress bar at top
- Hero mouse-parallax on dashboard mockup (rotateY ±4° / rotateX ±3°)
- Morocco map hover tooltips (city name, merchant count, latest transaction)
- Interactive pricing calculator (slider + tier toggle + persona label + live savings calc)
- Keyboard shortcuts overlay (press `?`)
- Button ripple on `pointerdown`
- Simple Mode live "updated X sec ago" timestamp

---

## 7. Known bugs / unfinished

From the automated QA audit (Nov 2025). BLOCKERS are fixed. HIGH items remaining:

1. **Dashboard has only partial `data-i18n` coverage.** Page greeting, KPI labels, block titles on dashboard do not switch when EN/AR is selected — they stay French. Fix: add `data-i18n` attributes to the ~30 dashboard strings; the i18n keys already exist in `i18n.js`.
2. **Command palette has no keyboard nav.** Footer promises "↑↓ naviguer" but only hover-highlight is wired. Fix: add keydown ArrowUp/ArrowDown to cycle `.kp-item.active`, Enter to activate.
3. **Modal/drawer focus traps are missing.** Tab escapes into the page behind. Fix: on open, focus first tabbable element; on Tab from last, cycle to first.
4. **Wallet `.f-card` tiles are `<div>`s, not `<button>`s.** Keyboard-unreachable. Fix: swap tag or add `role="button" tabindex="0"`.
5. **Landing mobile responsiveness:** dashboard mockup SVG `preserveAspectRatio="none"` stretches vertically at <375px; `.tx-head`/`.tx-row` 5-col grid squeezes below 640px; heatmap needs horizontal scroll below 480px.
6. **RTL polish:** `.dash-float` at `right: -14px` can overflow the viewport on mobile Arabic layout.
7. **Pitch deck is English-marked (`<html lang="en">`) but content is French, and has no lang switcher.**

See the full 85-item audit by searching for the QA agent transcript if needed; this project's next agent should keep a running todo file.

---

## 8. What's next (prioritized roadmap for the inheriting agent)

### Immediate (< 1 day each)
1. Fix the 7 HIGH items above
2. Add `data-i18n` to remaining dashboard/wallet strings
3. Run Lighthouse once — expect <90 performance from ungzipped font loads + grain SVG
4. Add `<meta name="description">` per page for SEO
5. Add `og:` and `twitter:` meta tags for social previews

### Short horizon (1–3 days each)
6. **Hook up a real backend** — even mocked via Supabase or Cloudflare Worker — for the signup wizard so real leads funnel into a CRM (currently pressing "Créer mon compte" does nothing but confetti)
7. **Build the Kiwi Invest UI** (Phase 3 in the pitch deck, not yet in Wallet) — fractional AMMC fund tiles, stock picker, halal filter
8. **Add the Pro-only surfaces** promised when the merchant toggles from Simple → Pro:
   - API keys + webhook log viewer
   - CSV import
   - Raw ledger query console
   - Bulk refund tool
9. **Dashboard live data simulation depth** — right now only the Pro dashboard's live feed animates. Simple Mode numbers are static; should tick.
10. **Real Moroccan photography shoot** — commission a 1-day photo shoot in Casablanca/Rabat/Marrakech of actual merchants. Replace the zero photos currently on the site with these.

### Medium horizon (1–3 weeks)
11. **Productize the Simple/Pro mode toggle** — currently a toggle; should be a smart default based on user's tenure (new user → Simple, power user → Pro) + an onboarding tutorial
12. **Kiwi Agent Mode upgrades** — right now it's 5 static suggestions; wire it to a real LLM backend (Anthropic Claude) for generative action proposals
13. **Push notifications / WhatsApp integration** — founder wants to keep merchants IN Kiwi, so build our own chat/notification layer rather than deep-linking to WhatsApp for every action
14. **Arabic UX QA** — find a native Arabic-speaking Moroccan merchant to review RTL layout. The current Arabic is plausible but not native-reviewed.
15. **Accessibility pass** — full WCAG 2.2 AA sweep (contrast, tab order, focus management, ARIA labels) — required for fintech compliance expectations in 2026

### Long horizon (built around real backend)
16. **Real KYC integration** — Sumsub or equivalent for CIN + selfie verification (currently a mocked wizard)
17. **BAM PE license filing** — the regulatory path mapped in the pitch deck requires this
18. **Merchant onboarding partner integration** — connect to Damane Cash or CDM Pay as sponsor acquirer (see `memory/kiwi_brand_system.md` for context)

---

## 9. Agent operating instructions

If you're an agent inheriting this project:

1. **Read this file first.** Then read `assets/tokens.css` (the design system), `assets/interactive.js` (the event model), and `assets/i18n.js` (translation pattern). That's ~800 lines total and gives you the architecture.
2. **Never edit `/tmp/kiwi-preview/` directly.** Always edit `/Users/zaka/Desktop/Gemma/kiwi/` and copy forward. The `/tmp` copy is the sandboxed preview runtime only.
3. **The dark-mode toggle was removed from the UI** per the founder's explicit direction (2026-04-24). The CSS vars still work if you set `html[data-theme="dark"]` programmatically, but don't re-expose the toggle unless explicitly asked.
4. **Simple Mode must remain sufficient for all daily merchant tasks** per founder direction (2026-04-24). Don't add features that are Pro-only by design — add them as mini-tiles, FAQ items, or contextual actions within Simple Mode too.
5. **Don't rebuild in React.** Vanilla is the stated architecture. If the founder asks for it, push back first: we can ship backend + deploy to Vercel without ever leaving vanilla.
6. **Memory system** — there are project memories at `/Users/zaka/.claude/projects/-Users-zaka-Desktop-Gemma/memory/` including user profile, brand system, and project context. Respect them.
7. **When the founder says "make it feel like $100M"**, the playbook is in `premium.css` + `ux.css` — pill nav, gradient mesh, mouse parallax, word stagger, scroll reveals, 3D card tilts, ripple, grain texture, count-up, marquee. Compound these; don't replace them.
8. **The 3 research agent briefs** (Moroccan market · $100M patterns · senior UX) were synthesized into this project. Re-deploying them is usually wasteful; read this file and the inline code comments instead.
9. **Known user style:** likes big ambitious scope, "take as long as needed" framing, wants parallel agent deployment for independent research, values tangible output over memos, will give direct feedback if something misses (e.g., "too simple", "still not fixed", "not a $100M website").

---

## 10. Build log since 2026-04-25 — the "merchant operations" layer

Everything below was added **after** the original handoff was written. It is the
work that should drive the next pass on the seed deck and pitch website. All
commits are on `main` at `github.com/badro99/Kiwi`; commit hashes referenced
inline for traceability.

### 11.1 Dashboard entry sequence — PIN lock + greeting flash (`47efc33`, `0dc12b3`, `314ba2b`, `21b8030`)

The dashboard no longer drops the user straight into the merchant view. On
every reload the experience is:

1. **Full-viewport PIN lock** — 4-digit numeric pad over a paper-colored canvas.
   Code mocked as `1234`. Cells animate `is-success` left → right on entry.
2. **Greeting flash** — "Bonjour Rachid," lands centered, holds ~600 ms, then a
   green Instrument-Serif italic types in to the right of the comma
   ("bienvenue dans Kiwi.") via a single max-width CSS transition with a caret
   on the ::after pseudo. See `/tmp/kiwi-greet-new.js` for the canonical
   timeline (cells settle 460 ms → lock fades → 1400 ms typewriter starts →
   2400 ms caret drops → 3200 ms greeting fades + dashboard dives in →
   4000 ms greeting removed).
3. **Dashboard "dive in"** — the demo bar + main app fade-up from underneath
   the greeting on a synchronized timeline.

This entry exists to make the seed-deck screen-recordings open with a moment
of brand voice instead of a static dashboard. Worth a 3-second clip in the
"Product" slide.

### 11.2 Caisse (in-resto checkout) — full PIN + équipe + split bill (`d4dc9f3`, `9f75584`, `95c4052`, `856acaf`)

The caisse surface (the on-Android-tablet checkout the staff use) is now a
miniature product of its own:

- **Staff PIN login** before any cashier action — each server has a 4-digit
  code, with an "Équipe" tab tracking who is on shift, on break, with
  messages to/from the manager.
- **Server assignment to tables** — visible avatars on every table tile
  (even empty ones) so the owner sees who owns which section at a glance.
- **Persistent split bill** — by item, by guest, or equal parts. State
  survives table switches and reopens with the bill mid-split.
- **Gamification** — tip leaderboard + service-speed badges per server,
  displayed in the Équipe tab.
- **iOS-style entry animation** after PIN success — zoom-in + welcome
  banner gradient. Matches the dashboard greeting flash in feel.

### 11.3 Serveur mobile app (`5982ea0`, `a3f279d`, `4d03e84`, `f45c1ad`, `70c1a5c`, `7ca843e`, `74cbd22`, `b401d7e`, `03daae3`)

A **separate mobile-first surface** for waiters running on their own Android
phone. Same brand language as caisse but with mobile-native gestures:

- 4-digit PIN before pointage (clock-in)
- "Vos tables ce soir" landing — the server sees only their own assigned
  tables, ranked by oldest order time
- Menu with category tabs, item modifiers, and a sticky "Voir la commande"
  bar that only appears in the Menu tab (regression-tested)
- Split par article (inverse model: pick the guest first, then tap items)
  + "Toutes regroupé par serveur" view
- Explicit "Lancer la commande" button — order isn't sent to the KDS until
  the server taps it (no auto-fire on item add)
- Background-persistent split — server can leave the table mid-split, come
  back, state is intact

**Implication for the deck:** Kiwi is no longer "the merchant dashboard" — it
is a 3-surface system (owner dashboard / cashier caisse / server mobile)
unified by the same brand. The pitch site needs a triptych shot.

### 11.4 Owner-perspective restaurant operations (`57edeb7`, `b6a712f`, `8f8eb04`)

The four restaurant features on the sidebar (Tables & additions, Menu, KDS,
Stock ingrédients) were reframed from "what a cashier does" to "what the
owner does from anywhere":

- **Tables & additions redesigned** as a strategic floor-plan tool — assign
  tables to waiters, drag-rearrange the layout, swap between presets
  (midi / soir / event), view per-table revenue performance + reservations
  + AI insights. **No cashier surfaces** (no "encaisser", no payment
  capture — those live on the Android caisse only).
- **Fullpage drawer mode** added to the interaction layer. New API:
  `Kiwi.fullpage({title, subtitle, body, foot})` — same DOM as `drawer()`
  but slides up from the bottom into a full-viewport overlay with
  max-width 1480 body centered and sticky head/foot. Tables, Menu, KDS,
  and Stock all open as fullpages now (they were cramped as side drawers
  — these surfaces will hold a lot of functionality going forward).

### 11.5 What this means for the seed deck + pitch site

The originals (built 2026-04-24) frame Kiwi as a single merchant dashboard
with Phase 1 SaaS pricing. They are now **incomplete** because they don't
show:

1. The 3-surface system (owner dashboard / caisse / serveur mobile)
2. PIN-locked staff workflows + server gamification
3. The full restaurant-operations suite (Tables / Menu / KDS / Stock as
   first-class fullpages, not sidebar items)
4. The cinematic entry sequence (PIN → greeting flash → dive-in)

When updating the deck and pitch website, the new narrative arcs to
emphasize are:

- **"One system, three surfaces."** Owner gets the dashboard. Cashier gets
  the caisse. Server gets the mobile app. All branded Kiwi, all sync'd.
- **"Designed for the owner who isn't in the restaurant."** The dashboard
  is strategic (assign tables, rebalance sections, see AI insights), not
  operational. The Android tablet and the server phone do the operational
  work.
- **"Staff are first-class."** PIN logins, équipe panel, leaderboards,
  pauses/messages, split-bill persistence. Not bolted on — designed in.
- **Phase 1 pricing — four tiers.** Kiwi Basic 199 MAD/mo (software only, own
  hardware), Kiwi Pro 399 MAD/mo (+ free cashier, T+1), Kiwi Ultra 1 499 MAD/mo,
  Kiwi Ultimate sur devis. Hardware loaned free from Pro up. Don't add public numbers / asks /
  projections to external materials (see `CLAUDE.md` and the no-public-
  numbers memo).

*Built over ~5 conversations between 2026-04-23 and 2026-04-24 with Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context). The aesthetic target was "indistinguishable from Mercury / Ramp / Stripe in 2026." Hit that bar on hero, calculator, dark break, glossary, pricing. Gaps remain on: real photography, native Arabic review, responsive edges <400px, focus management, real backend.*
